Brief description of R scripts
-- 1.organize_data.R: use the output of site-occupancy analysis from Luza et al. (2022) to organize data to network analyses .
-- 2.species_habitat_network_robustness_degree.R: network robustness to coral removal (based on coral degree - # associated fish) - will produce the basic_data for trait space analyses
-- 2.species_habitat_network_robustness_random.R: network robustness to simulated coral removal (based on random coral removal) -- Added after the 1st round of review 
-- 2.species_habitat_network_robustness_random.R: network robustness to simulated coral removal (based on coral removal following coral vulnerability to climate change) -- Added after the 1st round of review 
-- 3.trait_space_analyses.R: trait space area and occupancy by fish assemblages following simulated coral extinctions
-- 4.comparison.R: comparison of scenarios
-- functions.R: useful functions
-- packages.R: useful packages
