This is a working example to run the framework developed to assess network functional robustness in the context of cascading extinctions. The example is just illustrative, and did not intend to produce the same results as those reported in the manuscript.

The basis of the framework is the species-habitat network approach (Marini et al. 2019). The illustrated framework is depicted below. In step (1), we modeled the occupancy probability of fish as a function of coral and turf algae cover using site occupancy modeling. Based on the model output, we classified species as either coral-associated or co-occurring fish. In step (2), coral and fish species were connected based on the predicted site occupancy probability of each coral-associated fish (fish with different colors in the center of the network) relative to the cover of each coral species (corals with different colors, in the left). Then, coral-associated and co-occurring fish in subnetwork 2 were connected based on Pearson’s correlation values between fish site occupancy probability. With the networks established, we applied a removal algorithm that eliminated corals and subsequently calculated the direct and indirect effects of coral species removal on network robustness at each elimination step ($t=0,t=1, ..., |A|$). Lost links are shown in red. In step (3), we related fish species composition and species traits at each elimination step. In step (4), we computed the loss in trait space area following corals and fish removal. The area delimited by the black polygon depicts the trait space area at $t=0$, and the area delimited by the red polygon depicts the trait space area at $t=1$ Finally, in step (5), we applied a hyperbolic function (non-linear model) to the robustness data, analyzing both the remaining taxonomic diversity (TD, represented on the first y-axis with a solid curve) and functional diversity (FD, represented on the second y-axis with a dashed curve) along the gradient of coral elimination (x-axis).

We will simulate some data to illustrate the approach. Consider a set of eight species in the Partite A, 42 species in the Partite B, and 21 species in the Partite C (as our empirical data). The subnetwork 1 will be composed by the Partites A and B, and the subnetwork 2 will be composed by the Partites B and C. To fill matrix cells with values, we will gather values constrained between $[0,1]$, resembling fish occupancy probability ($\psi$) (subnetwork 1) and co-occurrence (Pearson's correlation $\rho$) (subnetwork 2) from a $Beta$ distribution with shape parameters $a=0.5$ and $b=1$. This will produce a distribution of values high density close to zero.


```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F,message=F}

set.seed(2456)

nspA <-8 # sp in Partite A
nspB<-42 # sp in Partite B
nspC<-21 # sp in Partite C
nspp <- nspB+nspC # all species

# create subnetwork 1
subnetwork1 <- matrix(rbeta(nspA*nspB, shape1=.5, shape2 = 1),byrow=F,
                      nrow=nspA,
                      ncol=nspB)
subnetwork1 [subnetwork1>1]<-1 # set to 1 values larger than 1

# create subnetwork 2
subnetwork2 <- matrix(rbeta(nspB*nspC,shape1=.5, shape2 = 1),byrow=F,
                      nrow=nspB,
                      ncol=nspC)
subnetwork2 [subnetwork2>1]<-1 # set to 1 values larger than 1

# set rownames() & colnames()
# subnetwork 1
rownames(subnetwork1) <- paste0 ("coral", seq(1,nspA))
colnames(subnetwork1) <- paste0 ("fish", seq(1,nspB))
# subnetwork 2
rownames(subnetwork2) <- paste0 ("fish", seq(1,nspB))
colnames(subnetwork2) <- paste0 ("fish", seq(nspB+1,nspB+nspC))

# establish a threshold of rho = 0.8 for a coocurring species
subnetwork2[subnetwork2<0.8]<-0
# rm empty cols
subnetwork2 <- subnetwork2 [, which(colSums(subnetwork2)>0)]

# arrange the matrices
# ordering (degree) --------------------
require(bipartite); require(igraph)
subnetwork1<-sortweb(subnetwork1,sort.order="dec")
subnetwork2<-sortweb(subnetwork2,sort.order="dec")

# define affinities
require(reshape)
subnetwork1_df <- melt(subnetwork1,as.is=T)
subnetwork1_df$aff <- ifelse (subnetwork1_df$value > 0.9, 1,0)
colnames(subnetwork1_df) <- c("coral", "fish", "value", "aff")


```

Note that in the last step we melted the object "subnetwork_1" and created the object "subnetwork1_df". We did so to make this new object the base for filter data and to establish a binary variable depicting the relationship between species of partites A and B. Now that we produced the matrices and sorted them, we can illustrate the tripartite network.

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

plotweb2(data.matrix(subnetwork1),
         data.matrix(subnetwork2),
         method = "normal",
         empty=T,
         col.interaction = "gray",
         ybig=1,
         labsize = 0.75,
         spacing=0.01,
         lab.space	=0.1,
         method2="normal",
         spacing2=0.01,
         empty2=T,
         col.interaction2 = "orange" ,
         col.pred2 = "orange",
         col.prey2 = "gray80"
)

```

As we already established the links between species in Partites B and C (fish in our empirical data), we will simulate one trait data set to be used in the trait-based analyzes. The trait values ($n=6$ traits) of species in the Partites B and C were gathered from Normal distribution with average $\mu=0$ and standard deviation $\sigma=0.2$. 

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# produce trait data
trait_data <- as.data.frame (
  replicate (6,
           rnorm (n = nspp, mean = 0,sd = 0.2)
           )
  )

# set rownames() and colnames()
rownames(trait_data) <- paste0 ("fish", seq(1,nspp))
colnames(trait_data) <- paste0 ("trait", seq(1,ncol(trait_data)))


```

After getting the trait values, we can start the trait space analyses based on the Partites B and C. First we will calculate the distances between species based on their traits, and run one ordination analysis (Principal Coordinate Analysis, 'dudi.pco' function of the package *ade4*) to summarize these distances into different vectors. I will use the Gower distance (package *cluster*) as it enables to handle with several trait types if one needs to (continuous, categorical, binary traits).

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# trait distance matrix (gower)
require(cluster)
gower_matrix <- daisy (trait_data, 
                       metric=("gower"))

# Building the functional space based on a PCOA 
require(ade4)
pco<-dudi.pco(quasieuclid(gower_matrix), scannf=F, nf=10) # quasieuclid() transformation to make the gower matrix as euclidean. nf= number of axis 

```

Now we will build the complete trait space. The area of this polygon is the Functional Diversity-FD measure for $(t=0)$, when no species elimination take place. We will apply the function 'chull' (package *grDevices*) to data of the two first PCoA axes, which will link species located in the boundaries of the trait space. Then the function 'Polygon' (package *sp*) will be used to get the polygon, enabling the calculation of the polygon area (FD). These two functions will also be used to group species and obtain FD for other groups (e.g. coral-associated fish, co-occurring fish).

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}
##  complete trait space
all_pool <- cbind (pco$li[,1:2],
              ext = F,
              sp = rownames(trait_data))

# convex hull
a_pool <- all_pool [chull(all_pool[,1:2], y = NULL),] # its convex hull

```

Then we can start the removal. Within the 'lapply' loop, there is a sequential selection of rows of the matrix 'subnetwork1'. As this matrix was already sorted, the selection obeys the degree criterion. The 'rm_corals' object define which species in partite A will be selected (from the species highest to the lower degree). Then we selected the species of partite B which have affinity with the selected species ('aff==1 & coral %in% rm_corals'), define the group of species (using 'chull'), and calculate FD (using 'Polygon' and extracting the '@area'). After we create, the 'RFS' object contains the result of the division of the difference between the complete and simplified trait space area by the complete trait space area. If no trait space was lost then $RFS=1$. As we were interested in how much remains, we calculated $1-RFS$ to be stored in our output 'res'.

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# --------------------------------------
# removal based on degree of Partite A
# calculate functional trait space loss
# based on RFS (Luza et al. 2022)
require(sp)
RFS_corals <- lapply (seq (1, nspA), function (ncoral) { 
  
  
  # choose the spp of Partite A to remove
  rm_corals <- rownames (subnetwork1)[1:ncoral]
  
  # coral-associated fish
  coral_associated <- subnetwork1_df[which(subnetwork1_df$aff == 1 & 
                                             subnetwork1_df$coral %in% rm_corals
                                             ),]
    
  # reduced space
  setB<-cbind(all_pool, ext1=ifelse(all_pool$sp %in% 
                                 unique(coral_associated$fish),T,F))
  pk <-setB[which(setB$ext1==F),]
  f <- pk [chull(pk, y = NULL),] # hull
  
  # quantifying reduction in functional space
  # https://chitchatr.wordpress.com/2015/01/23/calculating-the-area-of-a-convex-hull/
  chull.poly.complete <- Polygon(a_pool[,1:2], hole=F) # complete space
  chull.area.complete <- chull.poly.complete@area # polygon area
  
  # coral
  chull.poly.coral <- if (nrow (f)==0) {0} else {Polygon(f[,1:2], hole=F)} # reduced space
  chull.area.coral <- if (nrow (f)==0)  {0} else {chull.poly.coral@area}  # area
  
  # calculating reductions across all corals
  RFS<-data.frame (corals=(chull.area.complete-chull.area.coral)/chull.area.complete) # reduction in functional space area
  
  # results into a dataframe
  res <- list (remaining_associated_SR = 1-length(unique(coral_associated$fish))/nspB, # proportion of species remaining in partite B
               remaining_SR_all = 1-length(unique(coral_associated$fish))/nspp, # proportion of species remaining relative to the total
               RFS = 1-(RFS), # 1-RFS
               coral.associated =  coral_associated$fish[order(coral_associated$fish)], # removed fish
               corals.removed = rm_corals, # removed corals
               space.coral = f # trait space to plot
               )
  ; # return
  res
})

```

By running this we will end up with a list with length equal to the number of species in partite A. This output comprise the simulated losses in partite B (coral-associated) produced by the direct losses of species in partite A (corals). Then we melt the list to have the relevant results.

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# total functional loss
FD_loss_total <- lapply  (RFS_corals, function (i) i$RFS)
FD_loss_total<- unlist(FD_loss_total)

# loss species richness of partite B (coral associated fish)
CA_loss_total <- lapply  (RFS_corals, function (i) i$remaining_associated_SR)
CA_loss_total<- do.call (rbind, CA_loss_total)

# total SR loss 
ALL_loss_total <- lapply  (RFS_corals, function (i) i$remaining_SR_all)
ALL_loss_total<- do.call (rbind, ALL_loss_total)

# removal of partite A species (Corals)
loss_corals <- lapply  (RFS_corals, function (i) 1-length(i$corals.removed)/nspA)
loss_corals<- do.call (rbind, loss_corals)

```

We now proceed by creating a data frame for robustness analyzes. First, we create data for $t=0$ where no loss take place yet. Subsequently we bind to this data frame the results of the direct species loss.

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# analysis dataset
# first step of no loss (t=0)
analysis_dataset<- (data.frame (remain_all=1,
                               remain_fish_associated=1,
                               remain_coral=1,
                               remain_FD = 1))

# bind removals
analysis_dataset<-rbind (analysis_dataset,
       data.frame (remain_all=ALL_loss_total,
            remain_fish_associated=CA_loss_total,
            remain_coral=loss_corals,
            remain_FD = FD_loss_total))

# show the heading
head(analysis_dataset)

```

Now we will simulate the influence of the indirect loss of corals. We start by selecting the species in partite A (corals) and B (coral-associated fish) to be removed. Then we select associated fish plus those associated with them by checking which species has the sum of $\rho>0$. These species will be removed and the remaining proportion of species richness (SR) and FD calculated.


```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# simulating secondary (indirect) extinctions -----------------

RFS_corals_secondary_extinctions <- lapply (seq (1, nspA), function (ncoral) { 
  
  # choose the spp of Partite A to remove
  rm_corals <- rownames (subnetwork1)[1:ncoral]
  
  # coral-associated fish
  coral_associated <- subnetwork1_df[which(subnetwork1_df$aff == 1 & 
                                             subnetwork1_df$coral %in% rm_corals
                                             ),]
  
  # select associated fish plus those associated with them
  ass_cs <- subnetwork2[unique(coral_associated$fish),]
  ass_cs <- ass_cs[,colSums(ass_cs)>0]
  all_to_remove <- unlist(dimnames(ass_cs))
  
  # reduced space
  setB<-cbind(all_pool, ext1=ifelse(all_pool$sp %in% 
                                 all_to_remove,T,F))
  pk <-setB[which(setB$ext1==F),]
  f <- pk [chull(pk, y = NULL),]
  
  # quantifying reduction in functional space

  chull.poly.complete <- Polygon(a_pool[,1:2], hole=F) # complete space
  chull.area.complete <- chull.poly.complete@area # area
  
  # coral
  chull.poly.coral <- if (nrow (f)==0) {0} else {Polygon(f[,1:2], hole=F)} # reduced space
  chull.area.coral <- if (nrow (f)==0)  {0} else {chull.poly.coral@area}  # area
  
  # calculating reductions across all corals
  RFS<-data.frame (corals=(chull.area.complete-chull.area.coral)/chull.area.complete) # reduction in functional space area
  
  # results
  res <- list (all_to_remove = all_to_remove,
               richness_remaining = length(all_to_remove)/nspp,
               richness_remaining_associated = length(unique(coral_associated$fish))/nspp,
               RFS = 1-RFS,
               coral.associated =  coral_associated$fish[order(coral_associated$fish)],
               corals.removed = rm_corals,
               space.coral = f
  )
  ; # return
  res
})

```

As before, we selected the results we want, melt the lists, and bind to the data frame for robustness analyses.

```{r echo=T,warning=FALSE,message=F}

# total loss
loss_total_secondary <- lapply  (RFS_corals_secondary_extinctions, function (i) i$RFS)
loss_total_secondary<- do.call (rbind, loss_total_secondary)

# richness
loss_total_secondary_SR <- lapply  (RFS_corals_secondary_extinctions, function (i) i$richness_remaining)
loss_total_secondary_SR<- do.call (rbind,loss_total_secondary_SR)

# richness associated fish
loss_total_secondary_SR_CA <- lapply  (RFS_corals_secondary_extinctions, function (i) i$richness_remaining_associated)
loss_total_secondary_SR_CA<- do.call (rbind,loss_total_secondary_SR_CA)

# bind indirect extinctions in the analysis dataset
analysis_dataset<-cbind(analysis_dataset, 
                        data.frame  (remain_RFS_secondary = c(1,unlist(loss_total_secondary)),
                                    remain_SR_secondary = c(1,1-unlist (loss_total_secondary_SR)),
                                    remain_SR_secondary_associated = c(1,1-unlist (loss_total_secondary_SR_CA)),
                                    ext.lower=1,
                                    no = seq(0,nspA)/nspA
                   )
        )

```

Next we present the function and fit the non-linear model to the data (by Vinicius AG Bastazini). The object that the function requires is a data frame with the proportion of species remaining in partite A and the remaining SR or FD in the other partites. The function also have a function to plot.

After fitting the model to the data, we bind the predictions to the analysis dataset, and estimated network robustness by integrating (summing up) infinitesimally small values of the spline interpolated using the fitted hyperbolic function applied to the minimum and maximum of the proportion of removed partite A species/corals.

           subdivisions = max(100L,

# create a table to show robustness results
require(dplyr); require(knitr)
data.frame(rbind(SR_direct = SR1$value,
           SR_indirect = SR2$value,
           FD_direct = FD1$value,
           FD_indirect = FD2$value
           )) %>%
  kable(format = "pipe",col.names = "Robustness (R)")

```

Finally, we can now plot the robustness curves for direct and indirect effects of the removal of partite A species on the other partities.

Attack Tolerance Curves (ATC). The shaded area below each curve depicts the hyperbolic function curve fitted to the data shown in the two Y-axes. Yellow tones represent losses in functional diversity, while grey and black represent losses in taxonomic diversity. Diamonds and circles denote the direct and indirect effects of coral species extinction on such biodiversity dimensions.
